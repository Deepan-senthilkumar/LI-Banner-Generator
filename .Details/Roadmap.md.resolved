# 🗺️ Product Roadmap: LinkedIn Banner Studio

This roadmap outlines the execution plan to transform the current prototype into a production-ready SaaS platform. The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and performant application using React (Frontend) and FastAPI (Backend).

## 📅 Execution Phases

### Phase 0: Setup Prerequisites (Current)
- [x] Initial React + Vite setup
- [x] Feature-based folder structure implementation
- [x] Mock Services for rapid prototyping
- [ ] **Backend Switch**: Initialize Python/FastAPI environment
- [ ] **Testing Setup**: Configure Vitest (Frontend) & Pytest (Backend)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture
**Complexity:** Medium | **Status:** In Progress
- [x] **Routing**: React Router v6 setup with layouts
- [x] **State**: Context API for Auth and Editor
- [x] **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- [ ] **Backend Core**: FastAPI app structure, CORS, Middleware
- [ ] **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) connection implementation (replacing mocks)

### Phase 2: Editor MVP (The Core Value)
**Complexity:** High | **Status:** Partially Complete
- [x] **Canvas**: React-based banner rendering [BannerCanvas](file:///c:/Users/ELCOT/Documents/linkedin-banner-generator/src/features/editor/components/BannerCanvas.jsx#4-81)
- [x] **Modes**: Beginner vs Advanced controls
- [x] **Export**: `html2canvas` integration
- [ ] **Performance**: Memoization of canvas components
- [ ] **Input Handling**: Debounced inputs for smooth typing

### Phase 3: Project System & Templates
**Complexity:** Medium
- [ ] **Templates**: JSON-based template schema & registry
- [ ] **API**: `GET /templates` endpoint
- [ ] **Persistence**: `POST /projects` to save designs to DB
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Load user's saved projects from API

### Phase 4: Authentication & User Accounts
**Complexity:** Medium
- [ ] **Frontend**: Complete Login/Signup forms with validation
- [ ] **Backend**: JWT Implementation (Access + Refresh tokens)
- [ ] **Security**: Password hashing (Argon2), Rate Limiting
- [ ] **Protection**: Secure [ProtectedRoute](file:///c:/Users/ELCOT/Documents/linkedin-banner-generator/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.jsx#6-27) and API dependencies

### Phase 5: Brand Kit & Onboarding
**Complexity:** Medium
- [ ] **Brand Assets**: Upload logos, define color palettes
- [ ] **Storage**: S3/Cloudinary integration for user assets
- [ ] **Onboarding**: "Tour" component for first-time editor users

### Phase 6: Monetization (SaaS Features)
**Complexity:** High
- [ ] **Plans**: Free (Watermark), Pro (No Watermark, Brand Kit)
- [ ] **Payment**: Razorpay integration (Order creation & Webhook)
- [ ] **Entitlements**: `useEntitlements` hook to gate features
- [ ] **UI**: Upgrade modal and Pricing page

### Phase 7: Hardening & Deployment
**Complexity:** Medium
- [ ] **Testing**: E2E flows (Playwright), Unit tests (Vitest/Pytest)
- [ ] **Security Audit**: XSS checks, Dependency scanning
- [ ] **Optimization**: Code splitting, Image optimization
- [ ] **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deploy
